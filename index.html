                <h3>Academics, Research and T&P</h3>
                <p>These 3 seemingly simple words are the gospel for any engineering college and for us NITans, it is

no different. Being premier engineering colleges and Institutes of National Importance, all NITs are 

supposed to set a benchmark for others in the said fields. Producing top- class academicians and 

scholars, providing state-of-the-art technology and equipment for groundbreaking research and 

providing a platform for their students to get the best training and invaluable placements, are some 

of the aims of an NIT and they strive hard to achieve them. This session will provide an insight, for 

everyone, into the workings of the NITs in these fields. Students will present a scenario of their 

college in these areas; their pros, cons and the scope for improvement. Rest assured! This session 

will provide an amazing level of understanding that students should have of the intricate functioning 

of their college!</p>

                <p>Learn how LinkedIn's mobile web app manages control flow and application structure with promises and page controller components. As is the case with many original applications, the code-base of LinkedIn's first mobile web app was a bit like the "wild west." It was, in some areas, ill-suited to support the requirements of a large mobile web application that was constantly evolving at the hands of several teams. This session will share the problems faced, lessons learned, and solutions found while developing and scaling the LinkedIn mobile web app. After giving a quick primer on promises and explaining what the heck controllers are for, the session will dive into the use of promises to manage control flow and page controllers to manage page cycle, data, and memory.</p>
